# Design Patterns for building resilient applications across EKS Clusters

As organizations increasingly rely on Kubernetes—whether through Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or self-managed clusters on AWS—to power and scale mission-critical applications, ensuring resilience and high availability is crucial. Running workloads on a single EKS cluster can be convenient, but achieving high availability during operations like cluster upgrades, add-on updates, or workflow changes can be challenging. These operations may impact workload resilience and application availability.

This three-part series explores design patterns and strategies that bolster application resiliency through multi-cluster deployment on EKS.
